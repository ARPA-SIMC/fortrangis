/*! \mainpage FortranGIS.

A collection of Fortran interfaces to the most common Open Source GIS
libraries, plus some more Fortran-specific tools. Please refer to the
Project Summary http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fortrangis/ for
more information.

In order to start browsing the documentation I suggest to open the
Namespaces menu.
